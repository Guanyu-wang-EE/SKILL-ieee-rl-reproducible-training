# IEEE RL Reproducible Training

## Overview

Use this skill to make RL/DRL reproduction runs traceable while producing IEEE Transactions-style figures, train/test evaluation records, real-time monitoring artifacts, Chinese-first project documentation, and clean final experiment directories.

Keep this `SKILL.md` lightweight. Load the specific reference file needed for the current task instead of copying all detailed rules into context.

## Standard Workflow

1. Define the experiment hypothesis and minimum reproduction path: algorithms, environments, seeds, steps, metrics, and stopping rules.
2. Build the real-time trace structure before long training starts: stdout interval, CSV/JSONL interval, TensorBoard dashboard when available, optional MATLAB CSV monitor, checkpoints, plan summary, and manifest.
3. Run a small smoke test to verify the environment, CSV writes, stdout summary, TensorBoard event logging when enabled, optional MATLAB CSV readability when used, and checkpoint writes.
4. Start long training only after the smoke test passes; print PowerShell/Python training summaries every 10 episodes or at a fixed step interval.
5. Apply mid-run risk gates; stop and record when NaN, alpha/lambda explosion, unreasonable constraint violation, performance collapse, or environment interaction errors appear.
6. After training, run a separate evaluation/test pass with explicit checkpoint selection, test seeds, policy mode, metrics, and evaluation artifacts.
7. Generate IEEE figures, manifests, `threshold_summary.csv`, and a Chinese-first `output.md` report.
8. Verify completeness before cleanup; delete failed outputs and redundant exploratory files, but keep trustworthy successful runs.

## Resource Map

| Need | Load or use |
|---|---|
| IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid / Power Systems plot style, export formats, captions, SVG/font manifest rules | `references/ieee-plot-style.md` |
| Real-time training trace, stdout format, CSV files, TensorBoard dashboard, optional MATLAB monitoring, checkpoints | `references/realtime-training-monitoring.md` and `assets/monitor_training_template.m` |
| Train/test evaluation records, checkpoint choice, deterministic/stochastic policy mode, test seeds | `references/realtime-training-monitoring.md` and `references/reproducibility-recordkeeping.md` |
| Chinese-first README/requirements/output report, environment and SHA256 records, Python file header rules | `references/reproducibility-recordkeeping.md`, `assets/python_file_header_templates.md`, and `assets/output_report_template.md` |
| Early stop gates for NaN/Inf, OOM, alpha/lambda, constraints, reward collapse, CSV/fps anomalies | `references/early-stop-risk-gates.md` |
| Stage cleanup, failed-run deletion, successful-run preservation, naming discipline | `references/project-hygiene-cleanup.md` |
| Deterministic run trace verification | `scripts/validate_run_trace.py` |
| Deterministic IEEE figure manifest verification | `scripts/check_ieee_plot_manifest.py` |

## Operating Rules

- Do not wait until a run ends to write artifacts. Create real-time `progress.csv`, episode/update logs, stdout summaries, `stdout.log`, TensorBoard events when enabled, checkpoints, and plan-level summaries.
- Treat CSV/JSON artifacts as the authoritative reproducibility record; use TensorBoard as the preferred online dashboard and MATLAB monitors only as optional CSV-reading compatibility tools.
- Treat IEEE style as publishable scientific communication, not decoration. Use fixed dimensions, fonts, line widths, axis rules, export formats, and manifest records.
- Keep generated project documentation Chinese-first with bilingual technical terms at first mention.
- Stop clearly bad runs early and record why. Do not let bad runs contaminate aggregate summaries.
- Clean only after verification. Delete failed or exploratory artifacts, but preserve successful multi-seed, multi-algorithm, and repeated validation runs with time/seed/script naming.
- Do not create extra documentation inside this skill folder. Project `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and `output.md` are outputs guided by the skill, not skill-internal README files.

## Verification Commands

Run these when the corresponding artifacts exist:

```bash
python scripts/validate_run_trace.py path/to/run-folder
python scripts/check_ieee_plot_manifest.py path/to/figure_manifest.json
```

After editing this skill itself, validate the skill folder with the skill-creator validator.
