# Reproducibility Recordkeeping

Use this reference when creating or auditing project documents, run records, script headers, and result reports for RL/DRL reproduction projects.

## Chinese-First Project Documents

Generated project documentation must be Chinese-first. At first mention, give key technical terms in bilingual form, for example:

- 约束违反 (constraint violation)
- 消融实验 (ablation study)

Required project documents:

| File | Required content |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Chinese-first navigation page, direct conclusion, reproduction entry point, reading order, key artifacts, figure/PDF/SVG guide, risk boundary, key terms with bilingual first mention |
| `requirements.txt` or environment document | Python, conda env, PyTorch, CUDA, GPU/CPU, package versions, and teammate-machine setup notes |
| `output.md` | Expert-level result analysis, hypotheses, configurations, tables, IEEE figure index, figure quality evidence, paper differences, risks, and next-step recommendations |

When useful for the local hardware context, include compatibility notes for 4070/i7H machines.

## Required Records

Every credible run or stage must record:

- What was done.
- Stage status and reason for continuation, interruption, or completion.
- Which outputs are trustworthy.
- Which outputs were deleted.
- Algorithm, environment, seed, steps, metrics, and thresholds.
- Train/test split, evaluation seeds, checkpoint choice, and deterministic/stochastic policy mode.
- CPU/GPU, CUDA, PyTorch, Python, and conda environment.
- Exact command, output paths, and SHA256 manifest entries when a reporting package is generated.
- Plan-level `plan_summary.json` and threshold-level `threshold_summary.csv` when applicable.

For PPT-ready Markdown packs, figure/table requirements, reproducibility manifests, artifact indexes, PPT indexes, and missing-output notes, use `references/post-training-reporting.md`.

## README Expectations

Root `README.md` is the project navigation page, not only an introduction or changelog dump. Use GitHub-safe relative links so the same links work locally and online. It must let a teammate with general engineering background understand:

- direct conclusion and evidence tier;
- what the current run proves and does not prove;
- the recommended reading order;
- exact run directory, reports, figures, tables, manifest, and validation logs;
- how to reproduce or validate the run;
- which figures should be used in PPT and whether PDF exists;
- major risks, missing artifacts, and next steps.

For mature reporting packages, link at least:

```text
main report
summary report
debug/change log
risk_and_improvement report
figures README
figure_quality_audit
tables directory
reproducibility manifest
validation logs
```

Root README navigation must cover these locations with relative links when available, or state `NOT AVAILABLE: <reason>` when not produced:

```text
subdirectory READMEs: figures/README.md, tensorboard_events/README.md, or equivalents
reports: index, formal report, summary, ppt_index.md, colleague_briefing.md, risk report, debug/change log
figures: figures/ directory, figure README, figure_quality_audit, missing_figures.md
tables: tables/ directory, algorithm_comparison_summary.csv, run_summary.csv, eval_summary.csv, constraint_violation_summary.csv, artifact_index.csv
code: src/, scripts/, training entry, evaluation entry, post-train artifact generation script
configs: commands/configs/ or the project config directory
runs: runs/, progress.csv, stdout.log, checkpoints/, TensorBoard event directory
reproducibility and audit: reproducibility_manifest.json, artifact_index.csv, validation_logs/, skill_compliance_audit.md, completion_audit.md when used
missing outputs: missing_figures.md, missing_tables.md
```

Do not silently omit a missing category. Link `missing_figures.md` or `missing_tables.md` for missing figure/table packages; for other unavailable categories, write `NOT AVAILABLE` plus the reason.

Do not write as if long training has not happened when the true state is plan, running, stopped, failed, or completed. Keep the status explicit.

## `output.md` Expectations

`output.md` must include:

- Experiment objective and hypothesis.
- Configuration and environment.
- Seeds, metrics, thresholds, and project-defined success criteria.
- Evaluation/test setup, test seeds, policy mode, and whether `best` or `latest` checkpoint was loaded.
- Run summary and data tables.
- IEEE figure index when figures are generated.
- Figure quality audit and missing figure/table notes when reporting packages are generated.
- `threshold_summary.csv` rows when threshold sweeps are used.
- Comparison with the target paper or reproduction target.
- Differences from the paper and plausible causes.
- Abnormal events and handling.
- Expert risk assessment.
- Next-step recommendations.

Use `assets/output_report_template.md` when drafting this file.

## Python File Headers

Before editing generated Python experiment files, load `assets/python_file_header_templates.md`.

All `.py` files generated for these projects should start with the Chinese-first overview header covering purpose, creation date, input files or CSVs, output files, dependent scripts/modules, run example, and reproducibility notes.

Large one-command main/run/long-training scripts additionally use the Buddha blessing ASCII header and English blessing specified in `assets/python_file_header_templates.md`. This block is only for `main.py`, `run_*.py`, `train_*.py`, long-running launchers, and equivalent project entrypoints; it does not replace the Chinese overview header and should not be forced into small utility scripts.

Inside code, comment only non-obvious and reproducibility-relevant logic such as reward/cost normalization, constraint thresholds, alpha updates, seed fixing, and checkpoint strategy. Do not write empty comments for ordinary assignments or obvious logic.
