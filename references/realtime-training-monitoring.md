# Real-Time Training Monitoring

Use this reference before launching long RL/DRL runs or unattended repository long goals. Do not design training code that only saves artifacts at run end.

## Monitoring Stack

Use a layered monitoring stack instead of binding reproducibility to one viewer:

| Layer | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| CSV/JSONL artifacts | Required | Authoritative reproducibility record for audit, recovery, aggregation, and final figures |
| stdout and `stdout.log` | Required | Lightweight live status, warnings, FPS, and elapsed-time diagnosis |
| Checkpoints | Required | Recovery and model provenance through `latest`, `best`, and final model files |
| TensorBoard | Required for long training | Default online dashboard for multi-run, multi-seed, loss, constraint, and hyperparameter inspection |
| MATLAB `.m` monitor | Backup | CSV-reading fallback viewer for MATLAB-centered inspection or when TensorBoard access is blocked |

For long training, do not run end-to-end blind: create TensorBoard event files and a launch/view command before the run starts. TensorBoard must not replace the authoritative CSV/JSONL records or final IEEE figure generation. MATLAB monitoring reads the generated CSV files as the backup live supervision path; it does not justify omitting TensorBoard unless the blocker is explicit and approved.

## Repository Long-Goal Entry

Before editing or launching an unattended long goal:

1. Run `git status --short --branch` and record branch plus dirty state.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, relevant plan/index/protocol docs, configs, tests, and target source files.
3. Identify the first incomplete required gate or task.
4. Do not invent results, metrics, APIs, files, commands, or paper claims.

Ask only for destructive actions, scientific-semantics changes, major dependencies, architecture rewrites, unrelated expensive sweeps, or commit/push when not explicitly authorized. Otherwise choose the smallest conservative option from project docs and log the assumption.

Use faster hardware without changing experiment semantics. It is acceptable to tune `num_workers`, batching, evaluation parallelism, log flush interval, checkpoint interval, and device placement. Do not change reward/cost definitions, budgets, seeds, training steps, core hyperparameters, or algorithm semantics only to make a run faster.

## Required Run Files

Every run must write artifacts during training:

| File | Timing | Required role |
|---|---|---|
| `progress.csv` | Real time | Step/episode progress for monitoring and recovery |
| `episodes.csv` | Episode level | Episode-level outcomes |
| `updates.csv` | Update-batch level | Losses, alpha/lambda, and update statistics |
| `summary.json` | Final | Final status and aggregate metrics |
| `config.json` | Start | Reproducible configuration |
| `run_command.txt` | Start | Exact launch command |
| `git_commit.txt` | Start | Source revision and dirty-state note |
| `stdout.log` | Real time | Console trace retained for diagnosis |
| `diagnostic.json` or `gate_debug_report.md` | During or final | Gate/debug evidence and stopped-run diagnosis |
| `tensorboard/` or `tb/` | During long training | TensorBoard event files for online dashboards, not the sole scientific record |
| `checkpoints/` | During run | `latest` and `best` model states |

`progress.csv` must include at least:

```text
timestamp, algo, seed, env, step, episode, reward, cost, violation, alpha/lambda, actor_loss, critic_loss, fps, elapsed_sec
```

Use separate columns such as `alpha` and `lambda` when both exist; do not create ambiguous merged semantics in the actual CSV.

## Scientific Gate Records

Every gate must state:

- scientific claim;
- scope;
- metric;
- tolerance;
- observable class;
- verdict;
- artifacts;
- allowed next actions;
- blocked next actions.

Allowed verdicts are exactly `PASS`, `PROVISIONAL PASS`, `FAIL`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `BLOCKED`, and `NOT RUN`.

Allowed observable classes are `primary signal`, `scientific invariant`, `algorithmic assumption`, `evaluation evidence`, and `diagnostic-only`.

Diagnostic-only failures do not fail the whole goal unless they affect learning signal, safety semantics, evaluation validity, or a locked claim. A failed gate blocks phase advancement, not the whole goal.

## Stdout Discipline

Print a plan line before training:

```text
[plan] algorithms=... seeds=... steps=... out=...
```

Print a training summary every 10 episodes or at a fixed step interval:

```text
[train] env=CarCircle algo=ccpo seed=0 step=12000 ep=38 reward=-34.2 cost=1.8 cv=0.03 alpha=0.72 fps=820 elapsed=00:14:21
```

Use `[warn]` for project-defined abnormal events, `[stop]` when stopping a bad run early, and `[progress]` for non-episode progress summaries.

Warn on abnormalities defined by the current project, such as metric instability, artifact update failures, abnormal fps, or environment interaction errors.

## Five-Cycle Debug Rule

On any gate, test, or training failure, do not stop immediately. Run at most five distinct-hypothesis cycles without asking routine questions. Each cycle must:

1. reproduce the failure;
2. locate the first incorrect value;
3. state one concrete hypothesis;
4. run one minimal test;
5. apply one minimal patch when supported;
6. rerun the narrow test, gate, or regression check.

After five failed distinct hypotheses, mark `BLOCKED` with commands, logs, failed hypotheses, artifacts, and the smallest next decision required.

## TensorBoard Dashboard

- Require TensorBoard as the default online dashboard for long training when the project uses PyTorch, TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines, CleanRL, RLlib, or another compatible training stack.
- Record the TensorBoard log directory and launch command, for example `tensorboard --logdir <run-root>`, in the run README, `run_command.txt`, or monitoring notes.
- Log reward, cost, constraint violation, alpha/lambda, actor loss, critic loss, entropy/KL or equivalent policy diagnostics, FPS, and elapsed time using stable tag names.
- Keep TensorBoard run directories grouped by algorithm, environment, seed, and timestamp so multi-run comparisons remain interpretable.
- Flush events at a real-time interval that is useful for monitoring without turning event writes into a training bottleneck.
- Do not treat TensorBoard event files as the only record; mirror scalar values into CSV/JSONL artifacts for reproducibility, aggregation, and publication plots.

## Backup MATLAB Monitor

- Use a `.m` monitor that reads lightweight CSV files as the backup live viewer when MATLAB-based inspection is useful or TensorBoard access is blocked.
- Plot reward, cost/constraint violation, alpha/lambda, and fps/elapsed as four core views.
- Keep it visually clean but separate from final IEEE figure generation.
- Do not depend on the Python training process ending.
- Do not lock training files or block CSV writers.
- Use `assets/monitor_training_template.m` as the starting template when enabling this backup monitor.

## Monitoring Modes To Avoid

- Do not rely on final-only plots after training completes.
- Do not use notebook polling as the primary long-run monitor.
- Do not rely only on terminal progress bars without structured logs.
- Do not treat MATLAB as a replacement for TensorBoard in normal long training. It is a CSV-based backup viewer.

## Bad Run Stop And Exclusion

Stop and record bad runs early when they show NaN/Inf, OOM, exploding alpha/lambda, non-declining constraint violation, reward collapse, invalid transitions, stalled `progress.csv`, abnormal FPS, or checkpoint write/read failure. Record the stop reason in `summary.json` plus `diagnostic.json` or `gate_debug_report.md`.

Do not average failed, infeasible, stopped, smoke, short, or pilot runs into valid performance means. Keep them as diagnostic evidence or mark them excluded according to `references/project-hygiene-cleanup.md`.

## Checkpoints

- Save more than the final model.
- Keep `latest` and `best` checkpoints during training.
- Final artifacts must let a reviewer explain model provenance from `actor.pt`, `summary.json`, `config.json`, and `run_command.txt`.

Use project-conventional names such as `checkpoints/latest.pt`, `checkpoints/best.pt`, and final `actor.pt`. If the algorithm is not actor-based, `config.json` must explicitly name the replacement final model file.

## Evaluation / Test Pass

Training and testing artifacts must be separated. After training, run an evaluation/test pass that records:

| File | Required role |
|---|---|
| `eval_config.json` | Evaluation environment, episode count, seeds, checkpoint choice, deterministic/stochastic policy mode |
| `eval_command.txt` | Exact evaluation launch command |
| `eval_episodes.csv` | Per-test-episode reward, cost, violation, length, seed, and checkpoint source |
| `eval_summary.json` | Aggregate test metrics, feasible rate, checkpoint source, and policy mode |

Evaluation rules:

- State whether the policy is deterministic or stochastic.
- State whether evaluation loads `best`, `latest`, or another named checkpoint.
- Use explicit test seeds; do not silently reuse training seeds without recording that choice.
- Keep training metrics and evaluation metrics in separate files and separate report tables.
- Log whether evaluation uses the same thresholds as training.

## Plan And Threshold Summaries

At plan/report level, write `plan_summary.json` after the planned batch finishes or is interrupted. Include algorithms, environments, seeds, steps, output directories, completed runs, failed/interrupted runs, and retained/excluded artifacts.

For PPT-ready reports, manifests, artifact indexes, and missing-figure/table notes, use `references/post-training-reporting.md`.

During figure/report generation, write `threshold_summary.csv` when threshold sweeps or feasibility summaries are used. Recommended columns:

```text
algo, seed_count, threshold, reward_mean, reward_std, cv_mean, feasible_rate
```

## Smoke Test Before Long Training

Before long training, run a small smoke test that verifies:

- Environment creation and one or more interactions.
- CSV files are created and updated.
- Stdout summaries print in the agreed format.
- TensorBoard event files are created and readable.
- MATLAB can read `progress.csv` while training is active or simulated when the backup MATLAB monitor is used.
- Checkpoint write/read round trip works.

## Final Report Contract

Final reports must separate facts, assumptions, inferences, and residual risks. Include commands, seeds, configs, commits, output paths, gate verdicts, and artifact manifests. Before claiming completion, run `references/final-quality-gates.md`.
